  <p>Sleeping Beauty undergoes an experiment where sheâ€™s put to sleep on Sunday. Immediately after that, a fair coin is tossed. If it comes out Heads, Sleeping Beauty is waken on Monday. If it comes out Tails, sheâ€™s waken both on Monday and Tuesday. After being waken, the experimentalist asks Sleeping Beauty: <em>â€œWhat is your degree of certainty that the coin landed heads?â€</em>. He subsequently puts Sleeping Beauty to sleep, taking care to administer her an amnesia inducing drug that ensures she doesnâ€™t remember the experiment. Hence, everytime Sleeping Beauty is awaked, she wonâ€™t know which day it is or whether she has already been awakened before or not. What should her answer be?</p>
